<h2>Dear DiGi code team.</h2>
<p>I am writing you this letter because you are a well-known IT company that is also represented in my city.
<br> Also because I know you personally, since I visited your office a few months ago.</p>
<p>I would like to express my interest in applying for an internship at your company for the 
    position Front-end developer. I constantly monitor your vacancies on the <b>Dou.ua</b> 
    and I know that first and foremost you need a person with knowledge of React
    for this position.</p>
<p>I started my working path at the age of 16. I mainly worked in positions related to trade and English.
But at the same time, starting at the age of 16, I tried to make websites from time to time. It was more of a pleasure,
and accordingly I was not looking for a commercial realization of this hobby.
I already noticed that during the coding time flew by unnoticed, and I could easily dive into the work and recover when
it was late at night in the yard. At the age of 35, I realized that I do not enjoy trade, although I earned well, but coding attracted me completely.
And so I decided to systematically reconsider my life in terms of "What I do".
Because work in the first place should enjoible. Only in such activity can you grow infinitely.</p>
<p>I went to <a href="https://goit.ua/?lang=uk" target="blank">GoIT web-college</a> to complete the course <b>"Full stack JS React developer</b> in 10 months. This course
 also includes Node.js and React native.</p>
 <p>As I said before, learning is easy for me because I really like it.</p>
 <p>At this point, I have completed the layout course, possibly earlier than anyone from the stream, and exactly earlier
than the students in my group. And although I continue my studies, I would very much like to find a job, maybe not for a
full day, where I could practice in the acquired knowledge. After all, I noticed that you need to code every day, then
the skill is not only consolidated, but also developed. And the more interesting the task, the better skills I get
trying to implement it.</p>
<p>I am eager to discuss the contribution I can make to your company.</p>
<p>And of course I'm not claiming any financial reward. For me, the reward would be the opportunity to join your team and
be useful to you.</p>
<i>Sincerely, Artem Chubenko</i>
