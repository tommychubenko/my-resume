<h2>Dear friends.</h2>
<p>I would like to express my interest in applying for an internship at your company for the 
    position Front-end developer. I constantly monitor your vacancies on the <b>Dou.ua</b> 
    and I know that first and foremost you need a person with knowledge of React
    for this position.</p>
    <h3>My path</h3>
<p>I started my working path at the age of 16. I mainly worked in positions related to trade and English.
But at the same time, starting at the age of 16, I tried to make websites from time to time. It was more of a pleasure,
and accordingly I was not looking for a commercial realization of this hobby.
I already noticed that during the coding time flew by unnoticed, and I could easily dive into the work and recover when
it was late at night in the yard. At the age of 35, I realized that I do not enjoy trade, although I earned well, but coding attracted me completely.
And so I decided to systematically reconsider my life in terms of "What I do".
Because work in the first place should enjoible. Only in such activity can you grow infinitely.</p>
<p>At the end of 2021 - I went to <a href="https://goit.ua/?lang=uk" target="blank">GoIT web-college</a> to complete the course <b>"Full stack JS React developer</b> in 10 months. This course
 also includes Node.js and React native.</p>
 <p>As I said before, learning is easy for me because I really like it.</p>
 <p>At this point, I have completed the layout course, possibly earlier than anyone from the stream, and exactly earlier
than the students in my group. And although I continue my studies, I would very much like to find a job, maybe not for a
full day, where I could practice in the acquired knowledge. After all, I noticed that you need to code every day, then
the skill is not only consolidated, but also developed. And the more interesting the task, the better skills I get
trying to implement it.</p>

<h3>About my level of English</h3><p>
Interesting. But all my life is connected with the English language.
I graduated from a school whose main subject was English.
At university, I chose the specialty "manager of foreign economic activity", so most of my subjects were in English.
When I worked in my specialty, all office work and negotiations were conducted in English.
I had an online business for a while, and it required a lot of information from me, the primary source of which was the
English-speaking environment. <br>
In 2015, I passed the IELTS exam, which at that time rated my knowledge of English at 6.0, while “speaking” rated at 7.0
– Approximately it is equal to B2-C1.
Of course, since that time my language level has only improved, because I used it almost every day.
</p>

<p>I am eager to discuss the contribution I can make to your company.
And of course I'm not claiming any financial reward. For me, the reward would be the opportunity to join your team and
be useful to you.</p>
<i>Sincerely, Artem Chubenko</i>
